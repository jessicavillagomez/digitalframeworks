I want to know how many pandas are left in the world as of 2018. I think this data can be indicative of conservation efforts to save pandas and can show the changes of panda survival since the 2014 panda census. Given that organizations like WWF and other collective non-profits raise money to save the pandas, I’m curious if pandas are truly being saved and if so if it is directly related to conservation efforts. 

Researchers that track down pandas also rarely see them in the wild and have a difficult time tracking them down. 
Here is what I’m interested in collecting:
* The number of pandas in the wild 
* The number of pandas in conservation 
* Age of pandas 
* Sex of pandas
* Weight of pandas
* numbers of pandas 

I’d examine WWF files as well as other panda conservations for figures on the number of pandas currently in the world.
