I am wondering how many rat sightings there have been in New York City over the last summer (2017). I think this is important because it evaluates the number of rats that are visible in the summer months, when it is the most I found this [rat sightings data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/overview/) from the City of New York Open source data network. It is based on 311 service requests from 2010 to present. The data set it managed by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The city of New York regularly publishes open data of their community department and commissions including that of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The data of rat sightings itself is clean and numerical based on the unique key given to each incident, time stamp and type of rat sighting— classified as ‘rodent’. I think this data is also reliable because it is automatically updated daily and offers a clean key and detailed description of how the data was collected.

The office’s mission statement is as follows, “The Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) partner to form the Open Data team. As a hub of analytics in the City, MODA advocates for the use of Open Data in citywide data analytics and in the community.” This means open data is a priority of the city and is trademarked by them.
