This line graph shows the number of people that have borrowed under both the Federal Family Education Loan Program compared to the Direct Loan Program over the last nine years. I got this data from the national government data about teacher loan forgiveness. 

The Federal Family Education Loan Program was the second largest of the US higher education loan programs which acts as an indirect loan provided by private companies but guaranteed by the federal government. 

The Direct Loan Program is the largest federal student loan program where the UD Department of Education acts as the lender. It’s interesting to see how many students have taken out both kinds of loans and how the amount of borrowers has increased over the years. 

Sidetone: For whatever reason, I couldn’t get the legend to differentiate between the two so Federal Family Education Loan Program is in blue and Direct Loan Program is in red.
