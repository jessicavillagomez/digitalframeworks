A lot struck out to me from this data set. I also came to realize rather quickly that so much of data is sorting through what is and isn’t necessary or relevant in what you are looking for or seeking for a story. I started by making a pivot table in excel because I wanted to see the number of organizations and number of expenditures by entities tracked by the FEC with the word Trump in it. 
I looked through the list to organize the sheet by organization names and noticed one that made me laugh. There is one row for Julius Trump who has been written about before. The Trump Group is founded by a group of brothers that have an investment company in Florida. They have been sued by President Trump in the past and he has claimed that they use his likeness to benefit financially. I found it interesting because though the sheet isn’t about Trump’s expenditures specifically they bring up a character who in the past has been an enemy of sorts to the Trump business. The information is from the Royce Campaign Committee to Julius Trump for $1,000 as a refund. I wonder why this refund was given and what relationship Julius Trump has in politics if he is requesting a refund from a Republican campaign in California. 

Additionally, something that struck me was the organization “The Trumpettes”, a group of women that support Donald Trump who are named in the data set as well. It was only named once but I was looking at anomalies in the data rather than organizations that had a lot of entries in the data. According to the data, The Trumpettes gave $300 as event sponsors for Carla Spalding during the primaries. I think it’s interesting to see an organization of high profile women who support Trump and seeing this data makes me want to know more about them and makes me wonder if there is a connection between Carla Spalding and President Trump.
